# NSFW-Ransomware: Fileless Ransomware for Educational Purposes

![NSFW-Ransomware](https://img.shields.io/badge/NSFW--Ransomware-Fileless%20Malware-blue)

## Overview

NSFW-Ransomware is a proof of concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate the mechanics of fileless ransomware. This tool serves educational and research purposes only. Understanding how such malware operates can help improve defenses against it. This project explores techniques that use existing system tools and resources, which makes detection challenging.

## Topics Covered

- **Fileless Malware**: Learn how malware can operate without traditional file storage.
- **Living Off the Land**: Understand how attackers utilize existing software and tools.
- **LOLBAS**: Explore "Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts" that can be used in attacks.
- **LOLBINS**: Discover "Living Off the Land Binaries" that attackers leverage.
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Familiarize yourself with the framework that categorizes attack techniques.
- **Ransomware Detection**: Strategies to identify and mitigate ransomware threats.
- **Red Teaming**: Techniques for simulating attacks to test defenses.
- **Threat Detection**: Methods for recognizing and responding to threats.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering and analyzing information to predict and prevent attacks.
- **Windows 11**: Specific considerations for the latest Windows operating system.

## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/obeme2228/NSFW-Ransomware/releases). You will find a file that needs to be downloaded and executed. Follow the instructions in the release notes for setup.

## Usage

Once installed, you can execute the ransomware simulation. Ensure you are in a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine, to avoid unintended consequences. The tool demonstrates how ransomware can encrypt files without writing to disk, making it difficult to detect.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Execute the ransomware
./NSFW-Ransomware
```

### Parameters

- `--help`: Displays help information.
- `--simulate`: Runs the tool in simulation mode without making any changes.

## Features

- **Fileless Execution**: Operates entirely in memory.
- **Minimal Footprint**: Uses existing system processes to evade detection.
- **Educational Insights**: Provides detailed logs for analysis and understanding.

## How It Works

NSFW-Ransomware utilizes various techniques to encrypt files. It leverages existing binaries and scripts to execute commands in memory. By avoiding traditional file creation, it complicates detection efforts. The use of common system tools means that security software may overlook these actions.

### Key Techniques

1. **PowerShell Scripting**: Uses PowerShell to execute commands.
2. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**: Interacts with system management tools.
3. **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: Utilizes RPC to communicate between processes.
